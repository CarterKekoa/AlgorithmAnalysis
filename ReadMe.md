# Design & Analysis of Computer Algorithms
This project is an analysis of many different Algorithms. The same graphs are tested for both Lists and Matrixes to compare the complexity times.
Testing makes use of Googles CMake so to run the files you first need to  
'cmake CMakeLists.txt', this only needs to be done once.
Then for each change you need to do run 'make'  
and to run the various tests simply run './hw9_tests.cpp'
